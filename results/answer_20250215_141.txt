It can be integrated into applications and is known for its accuracy.\n\n2. **Amazon Textract**: A cloud-based OCR service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. It is particularly effective for structured documents like receipts.\n\n3. **Google Cloud Vision**: This API offers powerful image analysis capabilities, including OCR. It is a premium service that charges based on usage.\n\n4. **Azure Document Intelligence**: Similar to Google Cloud Vision and Amazon Textract, this service provides OCR capabilities and is integrated into Microsoft's cloud services.\n\n5. **Veryfi**: A specialized OCR software designed for receipt data extraction. It offers on-premises versions and is known for its accuracy.\n\n6. **Nanonets**: Another effective OCR tool for receipt scanning, which also provides on-premises options.\n\n7. **Taggun**: This tool is specifically designed for receipt data extraction and offers on-premises solutions.\n\nFor a comprehensive solution, you might consider using Tesseract for its open-source nature, or one of the cloud-based options like Amazon Textract or Google Cloud Vision for their advanced capabilities.", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 264, 'prompt_tokens': 592, 'total_tokens': 856, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_00428b782a', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f4ee5b67-88f1-414d-a8a0-b2fb94597666-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 592, 'output_tokens': 264, 'total_tokens': 856, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}))]}}
